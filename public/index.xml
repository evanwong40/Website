      <description>Hello world. Here are some cool things that I learned in python in SDS 348!
The first neat thing that we talked abot was using Regular expressions functions in python to mine phrases and lines! In homework 11, we were asked to create certain outputs by using regex functions on a provided string. My favorite part was using these regex functions to find the restriction sites for a specific enzyme because this was my first real exposure to how we can use coding to find something useful in relation to biology.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThe dataset,diabetes, was found on kaggle, and show shows a collection of data as part of the Pima Indian Diabetes Database. This is a subgroup of the data that consists of females that are aged 21 and above. The dataset column show the number of pregnancies, insulin levels, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, BMI, and outcome (diabetes or no diabetes). Before analysis, I predict that increases in each of the categories will have a corresponding increase in risk for developing diabetes, but further analysis will be done in order to validate this claim.</description>
